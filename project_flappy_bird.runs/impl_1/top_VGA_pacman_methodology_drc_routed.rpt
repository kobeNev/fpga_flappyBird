2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock CLK1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock CLK1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin CLK1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_100MHz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_100MHz_IBUF_inst/O, CLK1/clk_in1, SPRITE/clka
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
